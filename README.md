# ClusterScope: Customer Segmentation Visualizer

ClusterScope is an interactive data science web application that enables users to perform **customer segmentation using K-Means clustering**. The application allows users to upload customer datasets, determine the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method**, evaluate clustering quality with the **Silhouette Score**, and visualize customer segments through interactive plots.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end **unsupervised machine learning workflow**, including data preprocessing, clustering, model evaluation, and visualization using a Streamlit-based interface.

# Project Overview

Customer segmentation is widely used in retail, e-commerce, and marketing to identify groups of customers with similar behaviors. Businesses can use these insights to create targeted marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and optimize product offerings.

ClusterScope provides an easy-to-use interface where users can:

• Upload a customer dataset
• Select features for clustering
• Determine the optimal number of clusters
• Run K-Means clustering
• Visualize clusters in 2D using PCA
• Evaluate clustering performance with Silhouette Score
• Download clustered results

# Features

**1. Data Upload**

* Upload customer dataset in CSV format
* Preview dataset directly in the application

**2. Feature Selection**

* Select relevant numeric features for clustering

**3. Elbow Method Visualization**

* Automatically compute inertia values for different K values
* Plot Elbow curve to help determine optimal clusters

**4. K-Means Clustering**

* Apply K-Means clustering using scikit-learn
* Assign cluster labels to customers

**5. Cluster Visualization**

* Dimensionality reduction using PCA
* Scatter plot visualization of customer clusters

**6. Silhouette Score Evaluation**

* Measure clustering quality

**7. Download Results**

* Export clustered dataset as CSV
